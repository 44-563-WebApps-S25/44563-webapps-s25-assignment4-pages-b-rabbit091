    <h4 class="name helena">Helena</h4>
    <p class="speech helena">O, were that all! I think not on my father; And these great tears grace his remembrance more than those I shed for him. What was he like? I have forgot him: my imagination carries no favour in't but Bertram's.</p>

    <p class="speech bertram">Farewell, madam: I will with the king and make my fortunes as he pleases.</p>

    <h4 class="name lafeu">Lafeu</h4>
    <p class="speech lafeu">Good fortune and the favour of the king smile upon this contract; whose ceremony shall seem expedient on the now-born brief, and be perform'd to-night.</p>
